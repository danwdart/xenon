  <h1>What is Xenon?</h1>

<p>Xenon is a web based operating system designed with netbook users in  mind. A stripped down version of Linux boots into a full screen browser  that contains a local website that acts as an OS.</p>

<p><a href="pirate" target="_top">See the pre-alpha menu proof of concept</a></p>

<p>We have named it after the noble gas found in trace amounts, it  suggests stability and uniqueness which is the core concept behind our  OS.</p>

<p>You can do all the tasks every netbook user wants to accomplish.  Browse the web, work with documents, listen to music, etc. The OS shall  boot in seconds and work seamlessly on less powerful devices.</p>
