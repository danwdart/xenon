<h1>About Xenon</h1>
<h2>What is Xenon?</h2>
<p>Xenon is a new way to use your computer. It's a system that you don't have to have your own computer to use. It's a Web OS. There are two ways to use it:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Web</li>
<p>You log onto the website from any computer, log on, and there's your easy-to-use interface ready for you that will save all your files.</p>
<li>Off a CD</li>
<p>You download the small CD image and burn it to CD, and it loads up the system. This version does not require an Internet connection, but it helps because you can synchronise your data that you created using the system with the Internet. This version is the fastest, as it does not need to load the system from the Web every time, and doesn't have a backend of your original system behind it. (so no Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc).
</ol>
<h2>The CD: Software</h2>
<p>The CD in question is based on Linux and is designed to be able to be run on extremely low-end hardware. The OS has very few applications and thus will require hardly any memory.</p>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>Currently the Web OS contains images rotating around a logo. You can click any of these images to go into an application category. Later we will add apps to this.</p>
</h2>Future Plans</h2>
<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>We currently have to get the system as near perfect as possible, for the public to like it and to be able to use it simply and easily. The aim is to have all the apps you would expect from any system and integrate them into a web site, so even the worst computers can still access them. The system is currently in the development phase.</p>
<h3>Planned Apps</h3>
<p>The currently planned apps are a web browser, email, VOIP, instant messaging (Facebook-style, new chats appearing in a bar on the bottom), an office suite, and many others.</p>
<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>Submit yourself at the "Apply" page.You can pick any role, such as development, graphics, ideas, etc. We could do with as many people who apply as possible.</p>

<h2>To Do:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Menu System: Allow for alternating the speed of rotation.</li>
<li>Menu System: Add more images, decide on applications to include.</li>
<li>Add news and weather feeds.(e.g. Change the background to tomorrow's weather)</li>
<li>Add applications!</li>
</ol>
